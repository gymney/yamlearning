# info (not much my fault kings)

i'm planning to just use this for learning yaml (.yml files). main reason being, you can use it to insert secrets (personal access tokens) in order to use github api. without it, you can only get like 60 requests/day. for an authenticated user (hence, PAT), you get like thousands.

should be useful for hosting things later on, but im super new to this so i only have a hello world thing working, and one other thing that doesn't work. so, going well i'd say
